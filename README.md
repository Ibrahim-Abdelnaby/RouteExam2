# 🍔 Route Academy Food Website 🍕

This is the GitHub repo for the Route Academy Frontend Diploma Exam, where we build a comprehensive food/meals website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. The website fetches data from an API and displays a wide range of information about various meals, including instructions, origin, category, recipes, and more.

The main menu of the website includes the following links:

- 🔍 Search
- 📁 Categories
- 🌍 Area
- 🍲 Ingredients
- 📩 Contact Us

Users can explore and discover new meals, get detailed information about their favorite dishes, and even find recipes to try at home. The website is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, providing an enjoyable experience across different devices.

Feel free to explore the codebase, provide feedback, or even contribute to the project. Let's create a delicious and informative food website together! 🍴
